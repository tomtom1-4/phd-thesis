thesis [![Analytics](https://ga-beacon.appspot.com/UA-49657176-1/thesis)](https://github.com/igrigorik/ga-beacon)
==============

`LaTeX` thesis template based on *thesis* (version [4.0.3](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/thesis)) and *ClassicThesis* (version [4.1](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/classicthesis)) packages with custom and useful additions.

This template provides the following **enhancements**:

- Completely automated compilation task

- Additional typographical niceties

- Fixes and extensions (see file `settings.tex`):

	- **Bibliography** back-end default to `biber`

    - Support multi-line titles

    - Two different styles for chapter numbers

    - Integrated **analytical index**

    - Custom commands to indexing terms (e.g., `\keywordsub[category]{term}`)

    - Support for **acronyms**

    - Predefined custom environments (e.g., theorems, definitions)

    - Custom reference examples

    - Predefined **listings environment**

    - Predefined pseudo-code language and style for listings

    - Various utility commands (e.g., `\lwcase` to lowercase the first letter of the word that follows it)

## Prerequisites

- A complete `LaTeX` distribution (e.g., texlive).

- The `make` build automation utility.

## Workflow

The suggested workflow is:

1. Clone this repository:

    `git clone git@github.com:tomtom1-4/phd-thesis.git`.

2. Create a new branch:

    `cd ~/thesis && git checkout -b mythesis`.

3. First-time complete build of the thesis:

    `make -s thesis`.

4. Write a wonderful (not only typographically) thesis. No more excuses.

## Commands

* Remove all the generated files except the PDFs:

    `make -s clean`.

* Remove all the generated files:

    `make -s distclean`.

* Compile the thesis:

    `make -s thesis`.

    This command embeds the correct sequence of commands relevant for the proper compilation of the thesis, including analytical index, bibliography, and title page.

* Update the analytical index:

    `make -s index && make -s tex`.

## Editor

This template does not need any specific editor to work: you can simply use which editor you want.

However, if you prefer to use Sublime Text you can edit and compile `thesis` template simply installing [LaTeXTools](https://github.com/SublimeText/LaTeXTools) package.

Create a Sublime Text project file containing:

```
{
    "folders":
    [
        {
            "path": ".",
            "file_exclude_patterns": ["*-blx.bib", "*.aux", "*.bbl", "*.blg", "*.fdb_latexmk", "*.lof", "*.log", "*.lot", "*.run", "*.run.xml", "*.synctex", "*.synctex.gz", "*.toc", "*.sublime-project", "*.sublime-project~", "*.sublime-workspace", "*.sublime-workspace~"]
        }
    ],
    "TEXroot": "./thesis.tex"
}
```

Put the project file inside the folder, open Sublime Text and compile it (`CTRL + B`).

Note that this actions is equivalent to `make -s tex`. Therefore, before running it, you need to do a complete compilation (i.e., `make -s thesis`).

## Title page

An alternative and simple frontispiece is provided. See file `frontispiece_simple.tex` in the `frontmatter` directory.

How to use: substitute it to `frontispiece.tex` and run `make -s simplethesis`.
