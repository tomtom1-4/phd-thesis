\chapter{The Higgs as a Window to New Physics}\label{chap:three}
%************************************************

As we saw in the previous chapter, the Higgs boson has a very special place in the \acs{SM}, giving rise to the masses of all other elementary particles. But the fascinating properties of the Higgs boson do not end with the \acs{SM}. In fact many of the properties of the Higgs boson puzzle physicists to this day, but they can also serve as guidelines to look for physics beyond the \acs{SM}. The minimal supersymmetric \acs{SM} (\acs{MSSM}) for example was primarily proposed to solve the hierarchy problem, \ie\ the problem of why the Higgs mass is so much smaller than the Planck scale. Furthermore, state-of-the-art measurements hint towards a metastable Higgs potential, meaning that the universe could at some point transition to a new \acs{VEV}. The Higgs is also an excellent candidate as a portal to a hidden dark sector, thus possibly explaining the origin of dark matter \acs{DM}.

Although by no means a complete list of Higgs physics research, we want to highlight these three fields---the Higgs portal to \acs{DM}, the stability of the Higgs potential, and the Hierarchy problem---and briefly review them in the following chapter. It will also underscore the importance of precision calculations in the \acs{SM}

\section{Higgs Portal}
Every particle in the \acs{SM} was uniquely characterized by its mass, spin, the various quantum numbers under the $\SU{3}_C \times \SU{2}_L \times \U{1}$ gauge group. For example, the left-handed up-quark is in a color triplet, has isospin $+1/2$, and weak hypercharge $4/3$, whereas the right-handed electron is charged only under the $\U{1}$ group, with hypercharge $-2$. It is therefore conceivable, maybe even plausible, that particles could be neutral with respect to all \acs{SM} gauge interactions. In fact, the right-handed neutrino we introduced in section~\ref{sec:2:EW_symmetry_breaking} was exactly that. Furthermore, there is strong astrophysical and cosmological evidence for the existence of additional matter that does not, or at least not often, interact with the \acs{SM} (see Ref.~\cite{Cirelli:2024ssz} for an overview). This type of matter has the oblique name: dark matter. The nature of this type of matter is still an open question in physics, and countless models have been proposed, explaining it.

In this context, a frequently broad up type of model, are so Higgs-portal models. Here, the \acs{DM} interacts with \acs{SM} primarily via Higgs, thus explaining the name. This way, two \acs{SM}, could annihilate into two \acs{DM} particles for instance (see Fig.~\ref{fig:3:Higgs_portal}).

\end{figure}

Since the \acs{DM} is a singlet with respect to the $\SU{2} \times \U{1}$ group, a mass term would not generally break the gauge invariance, \ie\ the mass of the \acs{DM} particles does not have to be, or at least not exclusively, generated through the Higgs mechanism. The Lagrangian of a real scalar, a \textit{Dirac fermion}, and a real vector \acs{DM} field can therefore have the general structure
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\mathcal{L}_S &= \frac{1}{2} \left(\partial_\mu S \partial^\mu S - M_S^2 S^2 \right)  - \frac{1}{4} \lambda_S S^4 - \frac{1}{4} \lambda_{HSS} \Phi^\dagger \Phi S^2 , \\
\mathcal{L}_\chi &=  \bar{\chi} \left(i \slashed{\partial} - M_\chi \right) \chi - \frac{1}{2} \frac{\lambda_{H\chi \chi}}{\Lambda} \Phi^\dagger \Phi \bar{\chi} \chi, \\
\mathcal{L}_V &=  - \frac{1}{4} V_{\mu \nu} V^{\mu \nu} + \frac{1}{2} M_V^2 V_\mu V^\mu + \frac{1}{4} \lambda_V \left(V_\mu V^\mu \right)^2 + \frac{1}{4} \lambda_{HVV} \Phi^\dagger \Phi V_\mu V^\mu, \quad V_{\mu \nu} = \partial_\mu V_\nu - \partial_\nu V_\mu.
\end{split}
\label{eq:3:DM_Lagrangians}
\end{equation}
Here, $\lambda_{HSS}, \lambda_{H\chi\chi}$, and $\lambda_{HVV}$ are the dimensionless couplings of the particles to the Higgs, while $\Lambda$ is the new physics scale. The self-interaction terms proportional to $S^4$ and $V^2$ are not important for our purposes. To arrive at Eq.~\eqref{eq:3:DM_Lagrangians}, we postulated, that the Lagrangians respect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, that is the symmetry under which all \acs{SM} particles are symmetric, and all \acs{DM} particles are antisymmetric. This way, it is ensured, that every vertex must have an even number of \acs{DM} particles. Consequently, the lightest new particle will be stable, and hence present an excellent \acs{DM} candidate. The Lagrangian of a \textit{Majorana fermion} would be $1/2 \mathcal{L}_\chi$. Notably, the fermion Lagrangian is not renormalizable, due to the dimensionful coupling introduced by the new physics scale $\Lambda$. Nevertheless, the effective Lagrangian is rather convenient to parametrize the effects of new physics at some higher scale. The masses of the new particles are now generated partly through the Higgs mechanism, and partly through plain mass terms, such that the total masses reads
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
m_S^2 &= M_S^2 + \frac{1}{4} \lambda_{HSS} v^2, \\
m_\chi &= M_\chi + \frac{1}{4} \frac{\lambda_{H\chi\chi}}{\Lambda} v^2, \\
m_V^2 &= M_V^2 + \frac{1}{4} \lambda_{HVV} v^2.
\end{split}
\end{equation}

If the \acs{DM} particle, has a mass less than $m_H/2$, then the Higgs can decay into a \acs{DM} final state, altering the decay width of the Higgs. The partial decay widths read\footnote{We note that in Ref.~\cite{Arcadi:2019lka} the $H \rightarrow VV$ decay width contains $M_V$ instead of $m_V$, which we believe to be a typo, since it does not match the results presented in Ref.~\cite{Djouadi:2011aa}. Furthermore, in cases were the final state contains identical particles, our results differ by a factor of $1/2$ from Refs.~\cite{Arcadi:2019lka,Djouadi:2011aa}. We suspect that this is due a double counting of the phase-space by the authors.}
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\Gamma (H \rightarrow SS) &= \frac{\lambda_{HSS}^2 v^2 }{128 \pi m_H} \sqrt{1 - \frac{4 m_S^2}{m_H^2}}, \\
\Gamma (H \rightarrow VV) &= \frac{\lambda_{HVV}^2 v^2 m_H^2 }{512 \pi m_V^4} \sqrt{1 - \frac{4 m_V^2}{m_H^2}} \left(1 - 4 \frac{m_V^2}{m_H^2} + 12 \frac{m_V^4}{ m_H^4} \right), \\
\Gamma (H \rightarrow \bar{\chi} \chi) &= \frac{\lambda_{H\chi\chi}^2 v^2 m_H }{32 \pi \Lambda^2} \left(1 - \frac{4 m_\chi^2}{m_H^2} \right)^{3/2}.
\end{split}
\label{eq:3:Higgs_decay_widths}
\end{equation}
For a Higgs decay into Majorana fermions the decay width is $1/2\Gamma (H \rightarrow \bar{\chi} \chi)$.

At colliders like the \acs{LHC}, one can look for these invisible decays, either directly by looking for missing transverse momentum~\cite{ATLAS:2017nyv,CMS:2016dhk}, or indirectly by looking for modifications on the decay width~\cite{ATLAS:2016neq, ATLAS:2014hzd}. In both, the branching ratio of Higgs to invisible is constrained by
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{BR}(H \rightarrow \mathrm{inv}) < 20\%
\end{equation}
at the 95\% confidence level. This limit is likely to go down to 10\% with the inclusion of the run 3 data set, and could even reach a sensitivity of 5\% with data from the high-luminosity \acs{LHC}~\cite{Liss:2013hbb, CMS:2013xfa, Cepeda:2019klc}. With the partial decay widths in Eq.~\eqref{eq:3:Higgs_decay_widths}, we can then derive exclusion bounds on the existence of \acs{DM}. The results are presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:3:Higgs_portal_exclusion_bounds}.

The colored areas imply the exclusion of the particle at the 95\% confidence level. The computational setup is described in the \hyperref[chap:notation_and_conventions]{conventions}. The \acs{SM} decay width was set to $\Gamma_{\text{SM}} = 4.07\ \text{MeV}$.}
